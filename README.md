# Build an Advent Calendar Web App 🎄

This was made in advent calendar building & sharing session in Empathetech office hours.

#### Prompt 🎅

The exact design and concept is up to you, but here are some user stories to get you started.
As a user...

- :door: I should be able to see 24 "doors" (or pockets, envelopes, pouches, etc.), on the main page of the app, one for each of the first 24 days of December
- :chocolate_bar: I should be able to "open" a door for the current date and any past dates and receive a "treat." This can be a random gif, a riddle, a coding problem, a song lyric, or any other wild and fantastical item you dream up. The treat can either be displayed on the main page, or on a subpage
- 🗓️ I should not be able to open doors for future dates
